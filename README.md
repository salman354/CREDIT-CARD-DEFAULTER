#Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
#Overview
This is a classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card defaulter prediction. Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers.

#Dataset Information
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

#Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:

Training a RandomForestClassifier classification model to predict defaulter as accurate as possible.
Cleaning the datasets, fixing all features
Apply Classification ML model
Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.
Build the web app using Flask API
Upload the project on GitHub
Get the customer information from Web app
Display the prediction
Installation
